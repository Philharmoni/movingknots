The code is written in native R and should be compatible with R version >= 2.12

The moving knots model requires intensive matrix operations and one may compile R and
link with fast BLAS library whenever possible.

To run the code, please take a look at the "example" folder which contains a few setup
templates for configuring the model. You only need to use the "source" function to source
the setup template and it will run automatically and the summary of the results will be
printed on the R console.

For further assistance, please contact the package author Feng Li <feng.li@stat.su.se>
